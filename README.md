<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a school project for the IS442 Object Oriented Programming course, it is completed in a team of 3.

Social Magnet is a terminal app that has features similar to Facebook - add friends, post on their profiles, write comments on posts. It also includes a minigame that's similar to FarmVille where you buy seeds, plant them and harvest them to gain experience and gold. Experience helps the user to level up and get more plots to plant seeds in, and gold allows users to buy higher tier seeds to plant and hence gain more experience. Users can also send seeds to their friends. All of the data are stored within a MySQL database.

However, Social Magnet is merely a proof of concept and doesn't function as intended - the database has to be installed locally and isn't shared so users can't actually add friends across machines. Also, this application would be a lot more functional if a frontend is developed but it couldn't be done with the limited time given for the project.
